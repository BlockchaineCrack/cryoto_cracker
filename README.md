# cryoto_cracker
It is a software that searches for forgotten wallets, Each crypto wallet has seed phrase and private key, so we created software that generates seed phrases and checks available crypto coins in them via blockchains (BTC, LTC, ETH, SOL, USDT, BNB). Daily speed 60 Millions checks! And when it finds something, it shows us the found wallets in the window.


Then we copy that seed phrases, open found wallets in Trust Wallet app because it allows us to recover wallets by the seed phrase and transfer coins from lost wallets to the main ( your own wallet )
